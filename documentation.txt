For this project, I decided to use Node.js as the main framework for the Backend and simple JavaScript for the Frontend. 
I chose Node because I wanted to create something complete and stable within a single solution. 
I relied on Express for route and API management, and I used an external file, specifically a JSON file, to store all the information. 
I chose this over an external database because it allowed me to have something concrete and stable from the start.
If I had more time, I would have adopted the idea of using an external database to provide extra security for the data.

Inside, you will find:

A function that creates a short URL from a Long URL (the DB is set with an expiration time of 2 minutes)
A function to retrieve the original URL, if it exists and hasnâ€™t expired
A function to download the JSON file
A function to clear the entire form

Within the application, we find the following files:

fakeDB/fake_database.json: This is the file used as a database for storing URLs.
public/: Inside this folder, we find all the public files, including the index.html page and the external stylesheet style.css (located in public/css/style.css).
script/index.js: This is the external script file used by the HTML page to call the server's APIs.
src/app.js: This is the core of the Node.js server. It contains all the exposed APIs and the code to start the server.
package.json: This file manages all the dependencies used by Node.js.

Next Steps:

Adding a real database
Adding user authentication, with registration via form
Authentication control
Adding a framework (React/Vue) to improve the UI
